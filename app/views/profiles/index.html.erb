    About me

  <div class="about_me">
    I began professional experience in Luxemburg in 2010 where I joined a project that was supported by the European Commission, the aim of which was to boost student life quality in Luxemburg. During Master studies I worked at Allianz AMOS and was actively involved in the business intelligence area. I know what it means to be an excellent team player, open-minded, ultra-kind and I follow work ethos. I'm capable of implementing innovative thoughts and concepts in real-life situations and at fast pace. I love new challenges and never miss new opportunities.
